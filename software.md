# A list of bioinformatics tools we developed
----------------------------------------------

### [tdfdr](https://github.com/jchen1981/tdfdr)

- Two-dimensional false discovery rate control for powerful confounder adjustment in omics association studies
- [Paper](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-021-02418-8)

### [STA](https://github.com/TianshuFeng/STA)

- Semi-supervised topological analysis (STA), to explore the visualization of data based on Mapper, a topological data analysis method. 
- [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8888210)

### [DVboost](https://github.com/Liuy12/DVboost)

- Adaptive variant filtering using generalized boosted regression models

### [FFPEinput](https://github.com/Liuy12/FFPEinput)

- FFPEinput aims to provide RNA input recommendations (RNA concentration and library concentration) for FFPE samples in order to generate adequate data for RNA-seq. 
- [Paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12920-022-01355-0)

### [scRNAseq-vis](https://github.com/Liuy12/scRNA-seqVis)

- Web application for analyzing single cell as well as general bulk RNA-seq datasets
- Currently deployed at [here](https://yuanhangliu.shinyapps.io/scRNAseq-Vis/)

### [MBDDiff](https://github.com/Liuy12/MBDDiff)

- MBDDiff is designed specifically for processing MBDCap-seq datasets. MBDDiff contains three modules: quality assessment of datasets and quantification of DNA methylation; determination of differential methylation of promoter regions; and visualization functionalities.
- [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7359683)

### [XBSeq](https://github.com/Liuy12/XBSeq)

- XBSeq is a novel algorithm for testing RNA-seq differential expression (DE), where a statistical model was established based on the assumption that observed signals are the convolution of true expression signals and sequencing noises.
